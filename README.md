# SH 24 Coding test
Create a stepper to show order progress as per design provided.

## Considerations
I would normally work within a bigger framework based on project
(Bootstrap, Material, etc) and customise to suit the project's
need and ensure the project is fully responsive, compliant, etc,
however for the purpose of this coding test, this approach seemed
a bit heavy handed so I opted for a simpler, basic stepper.

I have opted to use sass as it is normally part of my workflow
however I also comfortable plain css.
